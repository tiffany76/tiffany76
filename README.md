### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technical writer looking for a full-time position, contract work, or engaging open-source documentation projects to contribute to. 

After 15 years as a librarian and information analyst, I decided to change careers to technical writing. I recently completed the [technical communication certificate program at UC Berkeley Extension](https://extension.berkeley.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&certificateId=17211&selectedProgramAreaId=15550&selectedProgramStreamId=15615). I have also been studying the command line, structured data, markup languages, static site generators, API concepts, and git and GitHub workflows.

My most recent open-source contributions are to [OpenTelemetry's website and docs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io). I also completed a copyedit of the [FarmData2 documentation](https://github.com/DickinsonCollege/FarmData2/pull/638) and wrote, designed, and published [Courtgrabber's documentation](https://github.com/tiffany76/courtgrabber-docs).

Please browse my [writing portfolio](https://github.com/tiffany76/portfolio) and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiffany-hrabusa/).
